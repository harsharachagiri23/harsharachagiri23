🌟 **ABOUT ME**  
I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with a passion for creating impactful digital experiences. With a **Master’s in Information Systems** from **Northeastern University** and a **Bachelor's in Computer Science**, I specialize in full-stack development using **React, TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, and AWS**. From building secure APIs to designing dynamic dashboards, I thrive on turning ideas into scalable, user-friendly solutions.

At **The Associated Press**, I designed **GraphQL APIs** to improve scalability and reduce response times, while integrating tools like **ECharts** and **AG Grids** for real-time dashboards. At **Icode**, I built secure APIs with **JWT authentication** and developed **OTP-based verification systems** handling high-traffic loads. My time at **Abecedarian LLC** sharpened my UI/UX skills through **Figma** prototypes, translating complex requirements into intuitive designs.
